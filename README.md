# Guillermo Arechiga 
Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I am a Full Stack Web Developer with over 4 years of experience, specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. I have extensive expertise in building scalable applications using modern frameworks and libraries such as React, FastAPI, and Express. My goal is to create efficient, maintainable, and high-performing web applications while continuously improving my skills in full-stack development.

## React + Vite + Tailwind + Three.js

This project template sets up a modern web development environment using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. It provides a fast, lightweight, and scalable way to build dynamic user interfaces and 3D graphics for the web. With Vite as the build tool, you'll enjoy blazing-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build performance. Tailwind CSS enables utility-first styling for rapid UI development, while Three.js allows you to create stunning 3D visuals directly in the browser.

## Libraries and Tools

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on component-based architecture.
- **Vite**: A next-generation, fast build tool that optimizes bundling and development workflow.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps create custom designs without writing custom CSS.
- **Three.js**: A 3D graphics library that simplifies the process of creating interactive 3D content in the browser.

## Features

- **React + Vite Setup**: A minimal React setup for fast development and optimized production builds using Vite.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Tailwind is preconfigured and ready for you to start styling your app with utility classes.
- **Three.js**: Three.js is integrated and ready to use for creating 3D scenes, objects, lighting, and animations.
- **Fast Refresh**: Using Vite’s HMR (Hot Module Replacement), updates to your code will be reflected in real-time in the browser.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run this project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuillermoArechiga/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite’s dev server. You should see a message in your terminal indicating the URL where the app is being served (typically `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your browser to view the app.

## Conclusion
