# React + Vite + Tailwind + Three.js

This project template sets up a modern web development environment using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. It provides a fast, lightweight, and scalable way to build dynamic user interfaces and 3D graphics for the web. With Vite as the build tool, you'll enjoy blazing-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build performance. Tailwind CSS enables utility-first styling for rapid UI development, while Three.js allows you to create stunning 3D visuals directly in the browser.
